report class:

getReasonTime function:
In the getReasonTime function, we firstly import the appointment data from appointment.txt file.
Then we read the first line of the file which should be the index for the database.
After that, we filter the columns which would be used in this function : time and reason.
Finally, we made these two attributes together in a list and save each of the list in the arraylist: reasonTime and return.
